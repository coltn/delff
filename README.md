# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
The main file is just several terminal commands merged into one.

The tool automatically deletes itself after use.

# Instructions

1. open terminal
2. type in `git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff`
3. type in `sh delff/delff`

# Why delete Firefox? Why make a tool?
I prefer Librewolf; and when I test out distros I get tired of uninstalling FF.
