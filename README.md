# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
Bash scripts or python programs require too many permissions or added configuration.

The tool automatically deletes itself after use.

# Instructions

1. open terminal
2. git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff
3. sh -e delff/delff

# Why delete Firefox?
I prefer Librewolf.
