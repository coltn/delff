# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
Bash scripts or python programs require too many permissions or added configuration.

The tool automatically deletes itself after use.

# Instructions

1. open terminal
2. run `git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff`
3. run `sh delff/delff`

# Why delete Firefox? Why make a tool?
I prefer Librewolf. When I test out distros I tired of uninstalling FF.
