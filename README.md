# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
The main file is just several terminal commands merged into one.

The tool automatically deletes itself after use.

# Instructions

1. Open terminal
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff`
3. Type `sh delff/delff`

* Or: Just open the [delff file](https://github.com/coltn/delff/blob/main/delff "delff") and copy/paste into terminal (no git required)

## Why delete Firefox? Why make a tool?
I prefer Librewolf; and it takes several steps to fully uninstall FF when I test out distros.

#### Note: This was tested on Pop!\_OS, which is Debian/Ubuntu-based.
