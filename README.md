# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
Bash scripts or python programs require too many permissions or added configuration.

Just copy the contents of delff.txt into a linux terminal

# Instructions

1. git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff
2. sh -e delff/delff.txt

# Why delete Firefox?
I prefer Librewolf.
