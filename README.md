# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
The main file is just several terminal commands merged into one.

The tool automatically deletes itself after use.

# Instructions

Run the contents of the delff file in a Linux terminal.

## Ways to do this:

### CLI / Git Method:

1. Open terminal
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff`
3. Type `sh delff/delff`

### Copy/Paste

* Just copy all the text in the [delff file](https://github.com/coltn/delff/blob/main/delff "delff") and paste it into the terminal

### Manual Download

* Download the [delff file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coltn/delff/main/delff "delff") and type `sh delff` into the terminal

## Why delete Firefox? Why make a tool?
I prefer Brave; and this will minimize the number of steps required to fully uninstall FF when testing out distros.
