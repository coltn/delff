# Delete Firefox (for Linux)

This is the easiest way I could find to automate the uninstallation of Firefox on Linux.
The main file is just several terminal commands merged into one.

The tool automatically deletes itself after use.

# Instructions

## CLI / GIT Method:

1. Open terminal
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/coltn/delff`
3. Type `sh delff/delff`

## Non-Git Methods:
(Copy/Paste or Manual Download)

* Just copy/paste the contents of the [delff file](https://github.com/coltn/delff/blob/main/delff "delff") into terminal, or
* Download the [delff file](https://github.com/coltn/delff/blob/main/delff "delff") and type `sh delff` into terminal

## Why delete Firefox? Why make a tool?
I prefer Librewolf; and it takes several steps to fully uninstall FF when I test out distros.

#### Tested on:
* Pop!\_OS, which is Debian/Ubuntu-based
* Linux Mint, which is Debian/Ubuntu-based
* EndeavorOS, which is Arch-based
* Manjaro, which is Arch-based
